#### A* Search Algorithm
Graph traversal and path searching algorithm
	Given a _start point_ and an _end point_, A* finds the most cost efficient path from start to finish by assigning a __g-score, h-score__ and __f-score__ to each _explorable node_ in the graph.
	The algorithm keeps the nodes within _open_ and _closed sets_. Nodes assigned to the open set being candidates for exploration while the already visited nodes are assigned to the closed set.
	
- __g-score:__ is the cost from the start node to via each node 
- __h-score:__ is a optimistic (heurisitc) estimate of the cost from a specific node to end node.
- __f-score:__ is the total cost estimation from the start node to the goal node via each node

##### g-score:
- Lower g-score: 
	- A node with lower g-score will be a part along a more cost efficient path from the start node
- Higher g-score: 
	- If a node is assigned a higher g-score it means the distance/cost of reaching the node in question along the current path, is increased. 
	
- The algorithm will favour the nodes with the lowest g-score when exploring nodes as these will yield the most cost efficient pathing

##### h-score:
- The optimistic heuristic estimate (h-score) is important as it guides the searching process by prioritizing the nodes that are more likely to yield the most optimal paths considering their estimated cost.

##### f-score:
- f-score is the sum of the g-score and h-score, it takes the whole path via a specific node to the end point into account. The algorithm will favor paths that strike a cost balance between the initial cost (g-score) and estimated remaining cost (h-score).
